#As usual, login to lab46, so we can get started on this adventure
#After logging in, let's go make a clean project directory

cd ~/src$/Projects
mkdir pbx1

#Now let's copy the project files into the new directory, but first we'll head
#to the public directory.

cd /var/public/spring2018/UNIX/pbx1/jruskauf
cp pbx1.ogg ~/src/Projects/pbx1

#Now that i have a copy, i can now begin to work on solving this puzzlebox
#The copy appears to be a bzip2 compression, so first off i need to uncompress it
#and direct the output into a clean file.

touch pbx1; bzcat pbx1.ogg >> pbx1

#huh, this file appears to be an archive.  Lets fix that up.

ar x pbx1; mv datafile pbx1
y

#Geez, there's a lot of Xs, lets get rid of them

touch temp; tr -d X < pbx1 > temp

#Looks like we have the vowels AEIOU, but the top half is mixed up a bit,
#and the bottom half looks like it needs to be on the top. Let's try and fix this.
#First, let's isolate the top half with "head -n", which gives line input

touch top; head -n 14 pbx1 > top

#Let's do the same for the bottom half

touch bottom; tail -n 13 pbx1 > bottom

#The top file seems to be wrong, the octal values are on the inside.  let's split
#them up a bit.

touch topright; cut -c 1-29 top > topright
touch topleft; cut -c 1-29 top > topright

#And now let's paste them together and put them back into the "top" file
#The -d "" will make it so that there is no tab between the pasted text
#Pasting it into bottom will now give us a full picture, but not completed.

paste -d "" topleft topright >> bottom
cp bottom pbx1
y

#Now that we have a full picture back in pbx1, it doesn't look quite right. 
# The octal values look like they've been flipped on both the x and y axis
#Let's undo this with tac and rev

touch temp; tac pbx1 > temp
cat temp > pbx1
y

#Now that we have the pretty spiral with all the octal values oriented correctly
#in their counterclockwise format, we need to submit the files and push them to
#the repository.
