#Set up variables and create the project directory, copy files, etc.  This is the same thing i did the last two times.

#Now we use file to determine the filetype, and it's a whole big messy thing.
#Turns out though xzcat partially unscrambles it, so let's put that into a file.
xzcat pbx3.cpp > pbx3

#Check filetype again, and it turns out to be a tar archive.  So let's decompress that into stuff.
tar -x -f pbx3

#ooh boy, lots of files, and everything seems slightly better.
#turns out datapart 1 and 3 are encoded, 2 is a gzip compression, and 4 is another
#tar archive.  Let's fix these up a bit so they're actually readable, hopefully.

uudecode datapart1
zcat datapart2 > part2
uudecode datapart3
tar -x -f datapart4

#ok, now datapart 1 and 3 are executable, but permissions don't allow me anything.
#Let's change that with chmod, and for the other two parts they're quarter faces.
#Why must we always piece together weird stuff like we're in a budget crime
#thriller?  This is Unix, not CSI Miami.

chmod 700 datapart1
chmod 700 datapart3

#now that everything is unscrambled, let's paste it all together, as well as
#remove the last line of the file, as it is just a blank space.

paste -z -d "" part* > rhalf
paste -z -d "" datapart1 datapart3 > lhalf
paste -d "" *half > pbx3.temp
head -39 pbx3.temp > pbx3.results

#check md5sum, everything seems a-ok.  Then all that is left to do is submit
submit unix pbx3 pbx3.results pbx3steps
